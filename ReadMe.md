## CLI project:

*This project is now a Ruby gem and can be found here: https://github.com/saschakala/coffee-drinks*

A database of different espresso drinks and their coffee to water to milk ratios (can be viewed by whether or not the drink contains milk for the lactose conscious).

...that plus a few surprises. 

Inspired by Bandersnatch.
