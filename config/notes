Project plan:

1. greet user:
    Hello! And welcome to the Bevvie Bevy: an interactive experience for coffee connoisseurs and novices alike.

2. give option to see full list of espresso drinks by name, or by whether they contain milk (true/false)
    What's in a name? A bean by any other name would taste as sweet.

    Type "list" to see a complete list of all the espresso beverages.

    Alternatively, for the lactose challenged amongst us, type "milk" or "no milk" to see drinks categorized by whether they contain milk.

3. shows numbered list (either from "list" or "milk")

4. prompts user to enter a number to learn more

5. provides more info

6. prompts user to see one of the lists again or to exit

(7. would you like a pastry with that?)
